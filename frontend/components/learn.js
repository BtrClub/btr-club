                <p>
                  At "Bigger Than Race", we differentiate ourselves from other
                  crypto venture capital firms by focusing on the intersection
                  of technology and social impact. Our investment philosophy is
                  rooted in our belief that the crypto industry has the power to
                  create a more equitable and sustainable world, and we seek to
                  invest in projects and initiatives that align with this
                  vision.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  We prioritize investments that have a strong social impact,
                  such as those that promote financial inclusion, support
                  underserved communities, or advance environmental
                  sustainability. We believe that these investments not only
                  create long-term value for our investors and portfolio
                  companies but also contribute to a more just and prosperous
                  society.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Our investment decision-making process is rigorous and
                  data-driven, and we conduct thorough due diligence and risk
                  analysis to evaluate potential investments. We prioritize
                  investments that have a clear and compelling value
                  proposition, a strong management team, and a sustainable
                  business model.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  We also take into account the macroeconomic environment,
                  regulatory landscape, and competitive dynamics of the market,
                  as well as potential risks and challenges associated with each
                  investment. Our risk management and mitigation strategies are
                  designed to minimize downside risks while maximizing upside
                  potential, and we work closely with our portfolio companies to
                  ensure that they are well-positioned to succeed.

                  At "Bigger Than Race", our investment process is designed to
                  identify and invest in the most promising crypto projects and
                  startups while minimizing risk and maximizing returns for our
                  investors. Our investment process consists of three key
                  stages: deal sourcing and pipeline management, due diligence
                  and evaluation, investment terms and structure, and
                  post-investment services.

                <br />
                <p>
                  We have a wide network of industry contacts, partners, and
                  advisors that enable us to source a steady stream of
                  high-quality deal flow. Our team actively monitors the crypto

                  conferences to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and
                  opportunities. We also leverage our Discord community to
                  engage with entrepreneurs and startups and identify potential

                <p>
                  Once a deal is identified, we conduct an initial screening to
                  assess its fit with our investment philosophy, focus areas,
                  and criteria. We prioritize deals that have a clear and
                  compelling value proposition, a strong management team, and a
                  sustainable business model. We also take into account the

                  If a deal passes our initial screening, we conduct a
                  comprehensive due diligence and evaluation process. Our team
                  conducts a thorough analysis of the technology, team, market,
                  and regulatory landscape of each deal to assess its potential
                  for success. We also engage with industry experts and advisors

                  Once a deal has passed our due diligence and evaluation
                  process, we work closely with the entrepreneur or startup to
                  structure the investment terms that align with our investment
                  philosophy and goals. We offer a range of investment
                  structures, including equity, tokens, and hybrid structures,
